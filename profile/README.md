# Atom Ag

**Atomistic intelligence from Liechtenstein**  
We build **machine‑learned interatomic potentials (MLIP)** and **ML‑accelerated DFT** to make materials modelling faster and more reliable.

## What we do
- **MLIP** for large‑scale MD and materials screening  
- **ML‑accelerated DFT**: surrogates, smart initialisation, and convergence aids  
- **Active‑learning loops** with uncertainty quantification (UQ)

## Status
Early stage — private pilots with research partners.  
e3nn-mlx is WORKING now!
